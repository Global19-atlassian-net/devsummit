title: Who can I contact for more information about accessibility?
---

We encourage participants with disabilities and/or special needs to provide details in the registration form or by emailing us at [chrome-dev-summit@google.com](mailto:chrome-dev-summit@google.com). This information will be kept private and distributed only to the individuals who need it to complete attendee requests. When you are on site at the summit and need assistance or have questions about accessibility, please ask a staff member at the help desk.
