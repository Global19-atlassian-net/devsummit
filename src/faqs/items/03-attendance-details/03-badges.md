title: Badges & Badge Pick-up
---

Badge pickup will be available starting at 8:00 AM on Monday, 11 November. Make sure to bring your photo ID along with your registration confirmation email, as we’ll need to verify it prior to assigning you your badge for this event. We’re OK with government issued licenses, passports, and other forms of identification. If you don’t have proper identification, you cannot receive a badge or gain admittance to the conference. Everyone is guaranteed a seat for the keynotes but the best seats will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis. So make sure to arrive early at the event!

Please note, you may not share, give, or otherwise provide your event badge to anyone. Badges aren’t replaceable, so don't lose yours or you won’t be readmitted to the conference. You must wear your badge to gain admission to this event, including the sessions, codelabs, and after hours. If requested by security, please display or provide additional identification. Badges may include your name and company or organization (if provided).
