title: I am a confirmed attendee to the summit, but now I am unable to attend. Should I cancel my registration?

Yes. If you can no longer attend, please update your RSVP <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/chrome-dev-summit-2019/registrations/my-rsvp/confirm-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. Login, click **Manage your registration & details**, and cancel your registration. Doing so opens your spot to others on the waitlist. Remember that you can still join us on the livestream via the [Chrome Dev Summit website](/devsummit)!
