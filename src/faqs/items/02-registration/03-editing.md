title: Can I edit my registration after I’ve submitted it?

Yes. Attendees can edit their info by going directly to the <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/chrome-dev-summit-2019/registrations/my-rsvp/confirm-account/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">registration website</a> until the registration is closed. You can also edit your registration form after you’ve submitted it using the link in your confirmation email.
