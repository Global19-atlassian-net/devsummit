You should have received an email with your confirmation code. We will have your badge ready for you at the registration desk when you arrive. At check-in, we must see your government-issued photo ID prior to assigning you an event badge.

**Note:** If you apply for an invitation to attend Chrome Dev Summit and do not receive a confirmation email, then you will be added to the waiting list. You will receive a confirmation email if a spot opens up.
