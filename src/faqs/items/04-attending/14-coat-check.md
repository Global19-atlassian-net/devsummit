title: Is there a coat check room? Can I also check my luggage?

Coat check is available and located on the first level of YBCA Theatre, off the main entrance foyer. After receiving your badge and SWAG at registration, the event staff will direct you to coat check. Coat checks are designated for coats, jackets and small bags. Large items such as luggage and suitcases are not allowed in the coat check area.
