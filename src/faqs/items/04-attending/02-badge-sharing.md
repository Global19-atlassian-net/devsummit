You may not share, give, or otherwise provide your event badge to anyone. Attendee badges aren’t replaceable, so don't lose yours or you won’t be readmitted to the conference. You must wear your badge to gain admission to this event, including the sessions, codelabs, and after hours. If requested by security, please display or provide additional identification. Badges may include your name and company or organization (if provided).
