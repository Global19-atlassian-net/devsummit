Please come to the Howard Street entrance to register. Staff will be on hand at the help desk to assist you with questions throughout the event.

Make sure to bring your government-issued photo ID along with your registration confirmation email, as we’ll need to verify it prior to assigning your badge for this event. We’re OK with government issued licenses, passports, and other forms of identification. If you don’t have proper identification, you won’t receive an attendee badge and won’t be admitted into the summit.
