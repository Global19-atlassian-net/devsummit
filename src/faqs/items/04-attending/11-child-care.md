title: Is on-site childcare available?
---

We do not offer childcare on site. However, we are offering a limited amount of reimbursement for childcare for those attendees that may require it. Childcare requests must be made in advance of **24 October** to qualify for reimbursement. Along with the request you must provide a completed W9 and indicate the number of children for which you need reimbursement. For more information, please check the "Interest in Child Care Reimbursement" box on the <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/chrome-dev-summit-2019/registrations/my-rsvp/confirm-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">registration form</a> if you haven't marked it already, and/or email us at [chrome-dev-summit@google.com](mailto:chrome-dev-summit@google.com).
